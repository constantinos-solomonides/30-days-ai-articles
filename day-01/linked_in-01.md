I’m running a 30-day experiment using AI to write articles and rebuild parts of my portfolio — deliberately, and with skepticism.

I use AI the way I’d use an enthusiastic junior: it helps me get roughly 80% of the way there, then I review, correct, and take responsibility for the result (Pareto principle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).

This particular entry focuses on **portfolio development**, not writing. I’m rebuilding scaled-down versions of older projects to get a clearer signal on where AI actually helps in real workflows — and where it doesn’t.
