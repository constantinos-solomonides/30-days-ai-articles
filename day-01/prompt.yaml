  series:
    theme: Using AI in article writing and development for 30 days as an experiment
    cadence: One article per day, published sequentially
    audience: Technically literate readers curious but skeptical about AI-assisted work

  article:
    day: 01
    title:
      prefix: "Day 01"
      guidance:
        - Reflective, not promotional
        - Hints at uncertainty or constraint rather than outcomes
    theme: Motivation for the experiment and how it will be conducted

    intent:
      - Explain *why* the experiment exists before *what* it produces
      - Establish credibility without authority claims
      - Make the process inspectable and falsifiable

    content:
      motivations:
        - Build deeper expertise in *correct* AI usage, not maximal usage
        - Create portfolio artifacts where AI involvement is explicit and reviewable
        - Re-implement scaled-down versions of past professional tools to test transferability

      experiment_rules:
        - Apply the Pareto principle: AI produces ~80% of the draft, human refines the rest
        - All core ideas and constraints originate from the author
        - This document serves as a living spec and may evolve across days
        - Use the paid OpenAI tier to mirror common corporate defaults

      transparency_requirements:
        - Explicitly state where AI was helpful and where it was not
        - Avoid implying productivity gains without evidence
        - Treat failures or friction as valid outcomes
