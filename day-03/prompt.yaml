  repository:
    url: "https://github.com/constantinos-solomonides/pytest-framework-example"
    role: "tracking artifacts, experiments, and reference implementations"

  source_context:
    scope:
      - docker-based vim sandbox
      - ai-assisted development
      - local llm via sidecar containers
      - agentic iteration inside containers
    constraints:
      - no direct host filesystem exposure
      - persistence via bind-mounted directories, not docker volumes
      - non-root user inside containers
      - UID/GID alignment with host where possible
      - avoid unsupervised or hanging execution

  parsed_notes:
    methodology:
      - "DID NOT import prior efforts to create an environment"
      - "DID use knowledge gained during two previous attempts"
      - "DID re-use the instructions given on the 2nd day with updates"

    technical_issues:
      - "UID handling is unsafe to set directly; UID is system-defined and read-only"
      - "GID usage acceptable; UID needs reconsideration under 20/80 rule"
      - "Directory /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/autoload/ does not exist on Debian-based images"
      - "Bind-mounting an empty directory masked pre-installed vim configuration"
      - "Autoload semantics in Vim were misunderstood; exists('*func') is not a valid autoload check"
      - "vim-plug bootstrap and runtimepath ordering caused repeated failures"
      - "PlugInstall did not create 'plugged' directory due to sentinel logic and masked mounts"

    process_observations:
      - "Several fixes required manual intervention"
      - "Solutions often emerged only after copying exact error output"
      - "Unsupervised execution paths would have left the system hanging"

    evaluation:
      effort_assessment:
        - "Effort aligns with 20/80 rule for a first run"
        - "No significant improvement over reusing existing boilerplate"
      disadvantages:
        - "Required navigating an unfamiliar setup compared to existing workflow"
      advantages:
        - "Provided learning opportunities and exposure to alternative approaches"

  interaction_summary:
    assistant_role:
      - "Generated initial Docker/Vim/AI sandbox scaffold"
      - "Proposed architectural options for persistence and seeding"
      - "Diagnosed Vim, vim-plug, and autoload issues step-by-step"
      - "Provided verification and debugging procedures"
    user_role:
      - "Identified concrete runtime and build errors"
      - "Corrected incorrect assumptions (autoload, UID safety, filesystem layout)"
      - "Applied fixes manually when automation fell short"
      - "Evaluated outcome critically against existing boilerplate"

  article_objective:
    goal: >
      Produce a reflective development review describing the attempt to build
      an AI-assisted Vim sandbox, focusing on practical friction, architectural
      trade-offs, debugging reality, and whether the outcome justified deviation
      from existing tooling.
    tone:
      - technical
      - critical
      - pragmatic
      - experience-driven
    audience:
      - senior engineers
      - developers experimenting with AI-assisted workflows
      - readers interested in containerized dev environments

  required_sections:
    - introduction
    - initial_goals_and_constraints
    - implementation_attempt
    - issues_and_failures
    - debugging_and_corrections
    - evaluation_against_existing_boilerplate
    - lessons_learned
    - next_steps

  output_requirements:
    format: markdown
    length: medium
    avoid:
      - marketing tone
      - exaggerated success claims
      - hiding manual intervention
    emphasize:
      - real failure modes
      - cost vs benefit
      - learning value over polish
