# 30 Days of AI — A Skeptical, Inspectable Experiment

This repository tracks a **30-day experiment** in using AI as a *tool*, not as an authority.

The goal is not to showcase what AI *can* do in isolation, but to document **how it behaves inside a disciplined workflow**, where ideas, decisions, and accountability remain human-owned.

The experiment deliberately treats AI like an **enthusiastic junior**: fast, helpful, and unreliable enough to require supervision.

---

## What This Repository Is (and Isn’t)

### It **is**:
- A record of **explicit AI-assisted writing and development**
- A portfolio built **with AI and personal expertise**, transparently
- A comparison between **known baselines** and AI-assisted workflows
- A place where drafts, prompts, edits, and reasoning are inspectable

### It **is not**:
- An AI demo repository
- A productivity or hype showcase
- A claim that AI replaces expertise or judgment
- A collection of “AI-written” content without accountability

---

## Core Principles

### 1. AI Is Used Deliberately, Not Maximally
AI is used following the **Pareto principle**:
getting roughly **80% of the way there is acceptable**, and the remaining work is done by editing, correcting, and validating.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle

### 2. Ideas Remain Human-Owned
AI may help with:
- Drafting
- Scaffolding
- Recall
- Exploration

AI does **not**:
- Decide what matters
- Define correctness
- Replace judgment

### 3. Skepticism Is Structural
This project is explicitly **AI-skeptical** — not in opposition to the tool, but to the way it is often marketed and over-trusted.

Skepticism is enforced through:
- Repeated disclosure in every article
- Explicit constraints in YAML
- CI checks that prevent omission or drift

## Repository Structure

The repository is intentionally structured so that **process is visible**, not just results.

### Branches:
| name      | Purpose                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| main      | Trunk branch, contains shared files and final versions of everything   |
| ris       | Tracks the evolution of the RIS document, defining the writing style   |
| dayN      | Tracks step-by-step updates of each day's progress                     |
| templates | Tracks templates, and updates therein                                  |

## Mandatory Series Disclosure

Every article in this repository includes a **mandatory disclosure** that states:

- It is part of a 30-day experiment
- AI (paid OpenAI + other models) is used deliberately
- The Pareto principle is applied
- LinkedIn short versions are generated using AI
- The author is AI-skeptical and treats AI as a supervised junior

This disclosure is **repeated intentionally** in every article.

The **separate "series metadata" document** is manually inserted in each article by design — articles are expected to travel across platforms where external context cannot be assumed.

---

## CI Enforcement

This repository includes a **CI-style validator** that enforces:

- Presence and structure of per-day YAML
- Required article sections and ordering
- Exact (whitespace-normalized) match of the canonical disclosure
- Presence of LinkedIn posts with required placeholders
- Absence of forbidden “series metadata” files

If any rule is violated, CI fails.

This is intentional: the experiment values **inspectability over convenience**.

---

## Article Types

The series includes multiple types of entries:

- **Reflective / opinion articles**
  Reasoning about AI use, constraints, and tradeoffs

- **Portfolio progress articles**
  Updates on rebuilding older projects to measure AI impact against known baselines

- **Portfolio showcase / demo articles**
  Walkthroughs of rebuilt tools, with explicit notes on where AI was and wasn’t used

Not every day produces the same kind of article.

---

## Why Older Projects?

Portfolio work focuses on **older projects built under real constraints**, not greenfield demos.

This allows:
- Clear before/after comparison
- Better attribution of what AI changes
- Fewer self-deceptive conclusions

Novelty is intentionally deprioritizedjas it would have reduced value

---

## How to Read This Repository

If you’re evaluating:
- **AI literacy** → look at prompts, edits, and constraints
- **Engineering judgment** → look at what AI is *not* allowed to do
- **Honest AI usage** → look at where progress slows instead of accelerating

Disagreement is expected. Ambiguity is documented.

## License and Use

Unless stated otherwise:
- Text and code are provided for inspection and discussion
- This repository is a record of an experiment, not a framework prescription

---

## Final Note

This project exists to answer a narrow question:

> *What does AI look like when it’s treated seriously, skeptically, and with accountability?*

Everything else is secondary.
