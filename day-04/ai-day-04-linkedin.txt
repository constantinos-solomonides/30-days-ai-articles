AI Day 04 - I did everything right and still failed.
It still failed.

No bugs.
No misconfigurations.
No hidden "gotchas".

Still blocked. ⚠️

On Day 04 of The Pareto Line experiment, the sandbox worked.
Local models worked.
OpenAI integration worked.
Codex launched.

And yet, I couldn't get a sandboxed agent to actually run.

Once you go AI-first, correctness is no longer enough.
Availability, billing ambiguity, and incentives start to dominate.

I could have bypassed the AI and continued manually. I didn't.
Letting the AI be a blocker was part of the test.

Two uncomfortable takeaways came out of this:

– When AI is unavailable and no agent can resume work, progress can stop harder than when the internet is down. At least then, man pages still work.
– Agentic tools are built by people incentivized to make them run more. Humans tend to optimize for economy of effort and predictability. Those incentives point in opposite directions.

Day 04 wasn't about broken infrastructure.
It was about failing while doing everything right.
